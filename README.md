Hephaestian is designed to process fanfic text for posting online.

It is designed primarily to accept text copy-pasted from Google Docs.
Scrivener (Mac and iOS only) and LibreOffice are also supported.
When rich text is copy-pasted in a web browser, it actually produces HTML behind the
scenes, but the HTML that Google Docs produces is not very good at expressing authorial
intent. Hephaestian cleans up that HTML so that it can produce output tailored to
specific sites' needs.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
