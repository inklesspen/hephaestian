  <body><p>“Now, Jim,” she said, “that key.”</p>
    <p>I felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a thimble, and some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.</p>
    <p>“Perhaps it's round his neck,” suggested my mother.</p>
    <p>Overcoming <i>a strong repugnance</i>, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with his own gully, we found the key. At <u>this triumph</u> we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival.</p>
    <p>It was <b>like any other seaman's chest on the outside</b>, the initial “B” burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long, rough usage.</p>
    <p>“Give me the key,” said my mother; and though the lock was very stiff, she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes<s>, carefully brushed and folded</s>. They had never been worn, my mother said. Under that, the miscellany began—a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six curious West Indian shells. I have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and hunted life.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath there was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like papers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of gold.</p>
    <p>“I'll show these rogues that I'm an honest woman,” said my mother. “I'll have my dues, and not a farthing over. Hold Mrs. Crossley's bag.” And she began to count over the amount of the captain's score from the sailor's bag into the one that I was holding.</p>
    <p>It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries and sizes—doubloons, and louis d'ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight, and I know not what besides, all shaken together at random. The guineas, too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth—the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick upon the frozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath. Then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without. At last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and gratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.</p>
    <p>“Mother,” said I, “take the whole and let's be going,” for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornet's nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had bolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man.</p>
    <p>But my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. That was enough, and more than enough, for both of us.</p>
    <p>“I'll take what I have,” she said, jumping to her feet.</p>
    <p>“And I'll take this to square the count,” said I, picking up the oilskin packet.</p></body></html>
